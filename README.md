- 👋 Hi, I’m @EzArsn
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in any language as I really like solving puzzles. So, developing a code or debugging also felt the same way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Data Science from freecodecamp.org. While learning, I've started writing some innovative codes or new approach which I'll be uploading here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as I love the opportunity to learn.
- 📫 I'm available in LinkedIn. Please contact me at
